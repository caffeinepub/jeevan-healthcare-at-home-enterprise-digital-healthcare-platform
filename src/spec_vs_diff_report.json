  "summary": "The diff updates global CSS theme variables in frontend/src/index.css to shift secondary/accent and related tokens to a blue hue (supporting REQ-1/REQ-2), but it also modifies the Internet Identity hook despite an explicit constraint not to change it. An extra project_state.json file was added that was not requested.",
